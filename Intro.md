# Intro
Welcome to the OEM C tutorial! Throughout these tutorials, you'll learn about the language C as well as learn a bit more about how computers and software works.

### A bit about C
C is a procedural language that was created in 1973 and was originally created to write operating systems. According to *techopedia*, a procedural language is:
> a type of computer programming language that specifies a series of well-structured steps and procedures within its programming context to compose a program. It contains a systematic order of statements, functions and commands to complete a computational task or program.

### Why do we use C?
C is fast. And by fast, we mean pretty much the fastest. When we’re running code on tiny microprocessors (MPU) that are orders of magnitude less powerful than your phone even, speed and efficiency of code is incredibly important. C produces some of the cleanest, leanest, and fastest code around. 

Since we are programing in C for AVRs (our “strain” of MPU), there are many libraries and compiling tools to turn our C into code that will run on our boards. Lastly, we program in C because it provides what we think to be the exact right level of abstraction. We aren’t writing raw machine code giving literal instructions to the MPU since that can get confusing very quickly and is hard to learn, and we aren’t writing Python where we basically tell the MPU what we want it to do, but have no actual idea what it is doing. C provides a level of abstraction where we are still very in touch with the actual MPU and all the bits on it, but allows us to learn it more quickly, and abstract away some of the unnecessary complications that come along with embedded firmware. 

### Why should you learn C?
Beyond the fact that you need to for OEM, it is also one of the most useful languages out there! Since C is sort of the grandfather of most modern languages, knowing it and how it works will not only make you a better C programmer, but will also make you a better Java, C++, C#, etc. programmer. C provides the backbone to many languages in different forms (interpreters, compilers, etc.) so the ability to understand how these work is incredibly useful. If nothing else, having another language on your resume is always good, and C is a great one to have!
